# Introduction to LangGraph - exercises

In this repo you can find some exercises to practisea long the course [Introduction to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph) by LangChain.

The goal of them is to make you think and really process their concepts, rather than just copy and paste code from their Jupyter notebooks. 

You can find two folders:
- [unsolved](unsolved) has the original exercises, with no response to them.
- You can see how I made each part in the [solved](solved) folders, just in case you need some help ;) .

Some considerations:


1. The exercises assume you have followed the course, and that you're familiar with outside concepts, such as API connection.
2. I've made the exercises while I was completing each module. This means that, for example, you won't need to watch Module 3 to complete the Module 2 exercises, but you'll need to have done the exercises from Module 1.
3. Use the same virtual environment as created during the course.
4. There are no exercises for LangGraph Studio.
